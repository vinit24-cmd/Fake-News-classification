# Fake-News-classification


Fake News Classification with Machine Learning
This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate fake news classification using different machine learning algorithms:

decision_tree.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates fake news classification using a Decision Tree algorithm.
random_forest.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates fake news classification using a Random Forest algorithm.
gradient_boosting.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates fake news classification using a Gradient Boosting algorithm.


Dataset
The notebooks use the Fake News dataset from Kaggle. The dataset consists of a collection of news articles, labeled as "real" or "fake", that can be used to train and test fake news classification algorithms.

Requirements
To run the Jupyter Notebooks, you'll need to have Python 3 and the following Python packages installed:

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook

You can install these packages using pip:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter

Running the Notebooks
To run the Jupyter Notebooks, first clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git


Then navigate to the repository directory and start Jupyter Notebook:

cd <repository>
jupyter notebook
This should open up a Jupyter Notebook instance in your web browser. From there, you can open one of the three notebooks and run the code cells to see how the fake news classification algorithms work.
